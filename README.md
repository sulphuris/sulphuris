# Sulphuris v1.0.2
Open-source CSS framework

> Minimal, modular and flexible, üúç Sulphuris aims to be the soul of your next front-end project. Inspired by [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css), but tailored to suit your everyday front-end development needs.

## WIP üöß

### Highlights

The goal of Sulphuris is to reduce the time of front-end development, not by offering a fixed already designed system, but by being flexible enough to be used in a variety of differently designed projects.

* **Themes** - separated from the rest of the code to enable quick and easy extension.
* **Less !important usage** - abstaining from `!important` usage as much as possible.
* **Spacing size classes in pixels** - e.g. `.pt-32` results in `padding-top: 32px;`, and `.pt--32` results in `padding-top: -32px;`.
* **XXL screen breakpoint** -  from 1680px.
* **REM units** - only for font sizes.
